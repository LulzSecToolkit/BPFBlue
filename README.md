# BPFBlue Passive Security Monitoring Tool

## Overview
BPFBlue is a powerful passive security monitoring tool built using eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) and bpftrace. It allows users to monitor various system calls and network events on a Linux system, enabling security professionals to gain insights into system activities, detect malicious behaviors, and analyze performance.

## Features
- Trace execution of programs using `execve`.
- Monitor network activity, including socket events and traffic.
- Sniff network packets with `tcpdump`.
- Trace file operations like opening and cloning processes.
- Monitor specific ports for potential malicious activity.
- Easy-to-use menu-driven interface with colorful output.

## requirements
sudo, bpftrace and tcpdump
   ```bash
sudo apt install sudo bpftrace tcpdump
   ```

## Install & Usage:
Warning ! Program using sudo.
   ```bash
git clone https://github.com/shadowpgp/BPFBlue.git
cd BPFBlue
sudo cp BPFBlue_2.1.sh /usr/bin/bpfblue
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/bpfblue
bpfblue [probe]
   ```


### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have `bpftrace` and `tcpdump` installed on your Linux system. You may need to run the script with `sudo` for proper permissions.
  
### Running the Script
1. **Make the script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x BPFBlue_V2.1.sh
   ```
2. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   sudo ./BPFBlue_V2.1.sh
   ```
3. **Follow the prompts** to select the desired monitoring option from the menu. Each option corresponds to a specific probe for monitoring system calls or network activity.

### Menu Options
Upon running the script, you'll be presented with the following options:

```
Welcome to BPFBlue Passive Security Monitoring Tool
Please select an option:
1. Execve Trace
2. Network Trace
3. Network Sniffing
4. Open Syscall Trace
5. Clone Syscall Trace
6. Socket Syscall Trace
7. Bind Syscall Trace
8. Listen Syscall Trace
9. Connect Syscall Trace
10. Event Trace
11. Monitor Specific Port
12. Exit
```

- **Select an option** by entering the corresponding number.
- If you choose to monitor a specific port, you will be prompted to enter the port number.

### Example Output
When executing a probe, the output will display information about the traced events. For instance, monitoring the `execve` syscall may produce output like this:

```
Execve syscall traced: Command - bash, Filename - /bin/bash, PID - 1234
```
